The notebooks located in this repository are named to ease the reading of our work. They unravel our workflow,from the data exploration to the implementation of our final model.

*N.B.* This is still a **work in progress**. The next steps are:
- fine-tuning the architecture of our model
- assessing the performances of our model with another preprocessing (denoising, data augmentation)
